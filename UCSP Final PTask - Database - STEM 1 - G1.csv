Although some older men still prefer to wear G-strings for comfort, most of the Tagbanwas are dressed like the non-tribe lowlanders. Many are able to speak and understand Tagalog and other dialects spoken in Palawan. The people's major sources of livelihood are agriculture and marine resources.

The basic social unit of the Tagbanwas is their nuclear family. The family practices monogamy. They live in compact villages of 45 to 500 individuals with houses made from bamboo, wood, and anahaw leaves to serve as roof.

Marriage is important among the Tagbanwas. An unmarried individual is considered odd among them. Polygamy, though allowed among the Tagbanwas, is rarely practiced. Divorce is generally practiced, but is discouraged by the elders if the couple has children.

The Tagbanwas are highly artistic in their sculpture. They use wood as medium for their artistry. They are also considered one of the earliest civilized groups in pre-historic Philippines. The Tagbanwas are one of the tribes in the Philippines which used ancient handwriting originating from South India. Actually, some of the older Tagbanwas still adhere to the ancient form of syllabic writing which was known then as ""Surat"". Some concerned groups are trying to preserve such legacies of the Tagbanwas.

On the ballot, he will appear under the name ""2 ILUSTRISIMO, NONOY (PPPL)"".","An interesting piece of information about Agutaynon is that aside from their official name, they also call themselves Palaweños, the same as with the Cuyunons. However, this has caused a mix of amusement and distress to the original tribal groups, such as the Palawan group, who outsiders call Palawano.

The Agutaynons’ main religion is Roman Catholicism, with 90% of their population practicing it. Other minority religions in their tribe are Protestantism and ethnoreligion.

As they are island dwellers, it is no surprise that their main form of livelihood is through fishing.

Just like other tribes and groups in the Philippines, the Agutaynons have their own set of traditional beliefs, said to have been inherited from their ancestors and passed down throughout generations. A few of them include: someone who sings while eating is considered ridiculous and disrespectful as they put value in the food as grace from God; a girl who sings in front of the stove while cooking will marry a widower; a dead person’s coffin should be fitted to his exact measurements, or else someone will die next; when planting rice, one should not bite or chew any of the seeds because the rats will then eat the planted seed; store owners should not sell salt at night or it will melt; neither should they sell a sewing needle at night, otherwise it will get lost."
